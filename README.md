# Spotify Search App

This web-app allows users to search for an artist to retrieve information about his/her albums. It utilises Spotify's API.

The application was built using React. I utilised [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for Webpack Tooling. No templates or CSS frameworks were used.

There are two ways to view this app:

Option 1: View online
------- 
The project is hosted online [here](https://spotify-app-cynthia.netlify.app/).

Option 2: Manual build
------- 
1. Clone repo
2. Run "yarn start" or "npm start"
3. Open http://localhost:3000/
